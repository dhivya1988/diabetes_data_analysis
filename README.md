# diabetes_data_analysis

Introduction

Project investigated the use of algorithms based on 
machine learning for early identification and treatment of 
diabetes. Using an extensive collection of data including 
multiple physiological and behavioral parameters, constructed prediction algorithms to identify patients at 
risk of diabetes.
Through extensive experimental data analysis, the 
preprocessing phase and model validation, got important 
insights into the ability to predict several machine learning 
techniques. The outcomes show that Random Forest was 
the best-performing model in Oversampling, with 
accuracy of 93.16% and in Down sampling Logistic Regression with accuracy 
of 52.53% on dataset.
